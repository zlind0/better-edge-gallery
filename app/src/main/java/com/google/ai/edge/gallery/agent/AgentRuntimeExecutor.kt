/**
 * Main entry point for executing the continuous Agent ReAct loop.
 *
 * The [AgentRuntimeExecutor] coordinates the lifecycle of agent execution, including model
 * initialization, task execution with streaming or synchronous outputs, session interruption, and
 * resource cleanup. It manages context assembly, system prompt injection, LiteRT-LM model
 * inference, tool execution, and event streaming.
 *
 * ### Lifecycle
 * 1. **Initialization:** Call [initialize] with the target [Context] and [AgentRuntimeConfig] to
 *    configure the model engine, prompt context, system instructions, and tool dispatchers prior to
 *    execution.
 * 2. **Execution:** Use [executeStream] for real-time reactive event streaming (tokens, loop
 *    state), or [execute] for a suspending call that collects the stream and returns the final
 *    [AgentResponse].
 * 3. **Interruption:** Call [interrupt] at any time to halt ongoing inference or tool execution.
 * 4. **Cleanup:** Call [cleanUp] when the executor or session is no longer needed to release model
 *    weights and system resources.
 *
 * **Thread Safety:** All implementations of [AgentRuntimeExecutor] MUST be thread-safe. Methods
 * such as [initialize], [execute], [executeStream], [interrupt], and [cleanUp] may be invoked from
 * different threads or coroutine dispatchers concurrently, and implementations must protect
 * internal state against concurrent access and race conditions.
